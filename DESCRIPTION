Description: The function stacktrace() dumps R's current context stack into a data frame.
  This stack may be somewhat different from the various fictions constructed by sys.*
  functions. Since this package inspects data structures that are not exported parts of R's API,
  it may be unstable or need tweaking to work on your system.
